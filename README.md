# RetailInsight-Optimizer 📊
Using Big Data & Machine Learning for Smarter Retail Marketing Decisions

## 📌 Overview
This project leverages the power of big data (Apache Spark) and R programming to analyze retail consumer behavior. We identify seasonal trends, cluster customers, evaluate marketing strategies, and predict future sales to enhance revenue and decision-making.
